# CollateralDamage

This mod incentivizes players to minimize collateral damage to non-objective, non-enemy buildings. Primarily comes into play in urban settings, but can also apply during "Capture Base" contracts. In vanilla there is nothing that prevents the player from leveling every building in the "base" they're supposed to be capturing and then just occupying the "capture region" and completing the mission. With CollateralDamage, doing so will still complete the mission, but there is a monetary cost associated with every building destroyed.
